Recently, I had the opportunity to attend a Google SDE2 interview. It was a challenging yet insightful experience that taught me a lot about technical preparation and communication skills.

The Question I Faced

During the interview, I was asked a problem involving building blocks and rainfall:

Question - After rain falls on a set of buildings of different heights, determine where the least amount of water will accumulate across the buildings.

This is a variation of the classic “Trapping Rain Water” problem, where careful reasoning and optimization techniques are required.

I attempted to solve it and explained my approach. The interviewer appreciated my effort, which boosted my confidence.

Key Learnings:

Strong Basics are Crucial -

The problem was not just about advanced DSA, but about applying fundamental concepts effectively.

It reinforced the importance of having a solid grip on core problem-solving techniques.

Interview is More than Solving Problems -

Initially, I focused too much on directly solving the problem with minimal communication.

Later, I realized that interpersonal communication and collaboration with the interviewer are equally important.

Explaining your thought process step by step helps the interviewer understand your approach and thinking style.

Balance Between Problem-Solving and Interaction -

Next time, I would aim to ask clarifying questions, verify assumptions, and actively involve the interviewer in my solution process.

This not only shows problem-solving ability but also demonstrates good teamwork and communication skills, which are critical for software engineers.

Takeaway:

Even though I may not have fully solved the problem, the experience gave me valuable insights:

Always stay thorough with the basics.

Don’t hesitate to communicate and explain your reasoning.

Interviews are not only about the final solution but also about how you approach and interact during problem-solving.

Overall, this experience made me more confident for future interviews and highlighted the areas I should improve upon.
